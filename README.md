This is my fork of the Resolume fork of the FFGL repository. Because more forks are forking awesome.

This is where I publish plugins I think are not really useful but also not really useless.

If you don't know anything about code and are here for the free stuff, head on over to releases: https://github.com/jorisdejong/ffgl/releases

If you know a little bit about code and are interested in drawing with OpenGL 4, head on over to the HelloTriangle example in the Master branch: https://github.com/jorisdejong/ffgl

If you already know your way around OpenGL and c++, there's nothing for you here and I will probably learn more from you.
